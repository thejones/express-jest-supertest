#Sample using Express, Jest, Supertest

As of right now everything supertest related passes. I assume I need to unmock something or change a config value. 
If that is not it, I suspect it is the way supertest does the expect vs what Jest uses. 


## Notes

I really do not know much about Jest. I found this https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/977
and watched K. Dodds egghead lesson.

Any help is appreciated.
